**Introduction:**
Our project is to create a hotel booking management system that will streamline the process of finding and booking accommodation. The system will feature an intuitive user interface that allows travelers to easily search for hotels within their desired location, travel dates, room type and price range. Additionally, travelers can view ratings and reviews from other users as well as detailed information about amenities and services offered by the hotel.
The system will also provide hotels with a platform to better market their properties and reach potential guests. Hotels will be able to list their rooms and rates, as well as provide detailed information about the amenities they offer, making it easier for travelers to find what they are looking for. In this way, our project will provide an invaluable service to both travelers and hotels alike, making it easier for them to plan and book their trips.

**Problem Statement:**

The problem our project seeks to address is:
1.	The time and effort required to find a suitable hotel without a booking website. 
2.	The lack of transparency in hotel pricing without a booking website.
3.	The risk of booking a room at fraudulent or low-quality hotels.
4.	The lack of reviews from other travelers to help users make informed decisions when booking a hotel.
5.	The lack of an easy-to-use booking system.
We aim to solve these problems by creating a user-friendly website that will make it easier for customers to search for and book accommodation. Ultimately, our project will provide travelers with an efficient and secure way to find and book the perfect hotel.
Actors:
